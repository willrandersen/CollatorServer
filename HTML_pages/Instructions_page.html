<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>The MOL Data Collator is a tool designed to pull all the information on a data point into an easy to use
    format.<br>It uses your MOL login to request all the necessary information, then parses it, and exports it to a
    table.
</p>

<p>The collator accepts three types of data points: Factory Order numbers, List ID numbers, and Project Inputs.<br><br>Project
    Inputs are the customer number of a project, followed by a colon, followed by the project name. <br>
    Examples include "1036808460:NYS16I101A", "1036311819:NE-14I103A", or "1035663683:Il-16I147A".
</p>

<p>The collator is capable of running a 'Project Search' which fetches all the data associated with the same project and
    customer number as the given FO/List ID.<br> Note that it is not necessary to enter two different data points and
    run project searches on both.<br><br>Project Searches are automatically ran when a project input is searched.<br>Running
    a Project Search on a List ID/FO is equivalent to running a project input search on the project containing the data
    point.
    <br><br>Data can then be exported to excel in the .xlsx format using the 'export' button above each search result table</p>

<h4>Basic Use Instructions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Enter FOs/List IDs/Project Inputs into the data point box. Add data fields as necessary.</li>
    <li>Check the box beside each data point to run a project search on it as necessary.</li>
    <li>Select 'Run Collator'. Once the search is submitted, you are free to leave the search page.</li>
    <li>Once the search is done the results will appear below the 'Start Collator'  button and be available in the home screen.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Additional Information:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Each search should take between 10 and 15 seconds for every 100 equipment items on a search.</li>
    <li>Orders from Risk may not be included in project searches, as they are listed under a different customer. <br> To remedy this, it is suggested to enter all risk data points in addition to the main project.</li>
    <li>Project Searches on FO/List IDs from Risk will not be processed.</li>
</ul>
